DESCRIPTION
===========

This is a fork of the kiss_sdl project, that I intend to use for a reboot of
my ramulate2 project. Ramulate2 uses radare2 APIs, therefor I do some modifations
to the original codebase kiss_sdl to take advantage of some powerful APIs of radare2.
Besides from ramulate2, I think this codebase can be useful for anybody,
who wants to create a graphical frontend for radare2 in pure C,
